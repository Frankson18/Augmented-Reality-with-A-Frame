# AR Fossil Museum

This project creates an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) experience using **A-Frame** and **AR.js** to display 3D models of fossils. The models used in this project are **Mammuthus primigenius** and **Triceratops horridus**, which are available through the Smithsonian 3D Digitization platform.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build an AR-based virtual museum where users can explore high-quality 3D fossil models. The scene is designed to be an educational tool, allowing users to visualize and learn about paleontology, specifically through fossils from the Smithsonian collection.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models:** View and explore detailed models of prehistoric fossils.
- **Marker-based AR:** Uses A-frameâ€™s AR.js integration to detect markers and display the models in the real world.
- **Custom Animations:** The fossil models rotate continuously to enhance the visualization.
- **Educational Text:** Accompanying information is displayed for each fossil model, detailing its geologic age, taxonomy, and other relevant data.

## 3D Models

The following 3D models are used in this project:

1. **Mammuthus primigenius (Woolly Mammoth)**
   - [Model Link](https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/mammuthus-primigenius-blumbach:341c96cd-f967-4540-8ed1-d3fc56d31f12)

2. **Triceratops horridus**
   - [Model Link](https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/triceratops-horridus-marsh-1889:d8c623be-4ebc-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125)

Both models are licensed under Smithsonian 3D Digitization and provide a high level of detail for an enhanced AR experience.

## AR Markers

This project uses the default **Hiro** and **Kanji** markers provided by AR.js. You can print or display the following markers to trigger the models:

- [Kanji Marker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867389-64bdf1ac-6191-11e7-9b1a-63a0dd2e2566.png)

## Educational Purpose

The AR museum is designed to serve as an interactive tool for teaching paleontology. It showcases important fossil specimens, their geological ages, and other scientific information, making it suitable for educational environments.

## Technologies Used

- **A-Frame** for 3D model rendering and scene creation.
- **AR.js** for Augmented Reality functionality via marker detection.
- **Smithsonian 3D Digitization** for high-quality fossil models.
